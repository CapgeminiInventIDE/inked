Evolving repo of the inked capability which turns strings into generated images for training with Natural Language Processing

## Usage


String-to-Image generation tool, designed to speed up data generation in Natural Language Processing, Scene Text Detection and other text as image projects.

Run a basic Hello World text as image generation.

``` python
from inked import WordGenerator

factory = WordGenerator()
word = factory.generate("Hello World")

word.save("Hello_World.png")
```

Generate images with no augmentations (transparent background removed for viewing):

![Hello World No Augmentations](docs/assets/imgs/hello_world_no_augments.png)

Or augment each individual character and the whole word to create truly endless images:

![Hello World Augmentations](docs/assets/imgs/hello_world_augments.png)

![Hello World Augmentations2](docs/assets/imgs/hello_world_augments2.png)
