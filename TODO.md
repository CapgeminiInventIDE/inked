# Github Wishlist

[ ] Add more augmentations
[ ] Finalize the frontend demo - what options do we want to add
[ ] Create Providers for Fonts, Background images etc - faker providers maybe? - Move all data (backgrounds, fonts) into S3 and store in ~/.inked
[ ] Add documentation into GitHub on CapgeminiInventIDE
[ ] New lines to produce full images
[ ] Change how augmentor config is working, since as it stands its quite annoying for a user to edit the augmentations (see the readme).
[ ] Enable word augmentations without character augmentations (currently only possible if you disable all char augments)
[ ] Replace with Warehouse class? has Font/Scribe/Setter + whitelists
[ ] Documentation for serving of scribe models
[ ] Include high level software architecture diagram in docs (how to blend image augs, fonts, backgrounds, mnist, dictionaries, nlpaug, handwritten etc)
